# BillingMachine
Make a billing machine for the XYZ Cafe. The machine consist of a group of buttons each representing a unique dish. There will also be a different set of buttons representing the quantity. To place an order, you will have to use these buttons in combination. For example, to order 4 cups of coffee, you will have to press "4 C". The machine will generate a copy of the bill for the customer and also add the amount of the order in "Total earning". So, at the end of the day, the owner can see how much he made in sales.
